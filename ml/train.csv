my husband has fever for 10 days and abdominal pain while passing stools what is his problem,hello I feel very sorry to hear about your husband and very rightly understand your concern and temptation for his unresolving symptoms you are perfectly right that if treatment were given rightly he should have shown some improvement but unfortunately he did until now so considering all the information you provided to me there are few possibilities first of all is typhoid fever which is a bacterial infection the second is intestinal amebiasis which is a parasitic infection typhoid seems to be likely possibly given his almost 10 days of fever and in second week he started to develop abdominal pain which is suggestive of typhoid ulcers in small bowel I would suggest him an antibiotic course for at least 10 days and a maximum of 14 days which would cover both potential bugs I also want that you get him some blood and stool tests before starting antibiotic course the antibiotic course is relatively safe I also want that you closely examine his chest for the development of rose spots they are very small pinkish marks which develop among patient over the chest in the second week of the illness do not worry they are harmless it is just a manifestation I really hope his symptoms will improve like a fever would start settle and abdominal pain should resolve in the next 48 to 72 hours of the start of the antibiotic regimen I would also want to know the assessment prescription of a previous doctor who said about colopathy the colopathy is a very broad and vague term which means colon large bowel inflammation it has a number of causes the one is painkillers nsaids and recently couid 19 has shows some case reports with colopathy but if your family and he himself does not have any contact history to couid 19 positive or suspected case then the possibility is very rare ultrasound is not a sensitive investigation for the disease which involves the bowel lumen such as in your husband case ultrasound is more helpful in disease involving liver spleen or gall bladder so it is not uncommon to have a normal ultrasound with conditions like typhoid fever or intestinal amebiasis so I am writing him antibiotics for 10 days now if the improvement is shown we would increase up to 14 days I really hope with this course his symptoms will start settling in the next 48 to 72 hours and lastly get some blood and stool tests as I suggest her and discuss the reports once they are available typhoid fever intestinal amebiasis difficile infection colopathy complete blood count blood culture and sensitivity before starting antibiotic course ha titer for histolytica stool detail report and ova parasites stool for fecal calprotectin stool for difficile infection and stool for culture and sensitivity before starting antibiotic course you can ask him to give sample today and start antibiotics just after giving the sample capsule cefixime 400 my twice daily for 10 days tablet flagyl 400 my thrice daily for seven days this antibiotic can cause metallic taste in mouth and or decreased appetite for that you can give him tablet levosulpiride 25 my thrice daily half hour before meals for nausea appetite take home cooked meals take good amount of water mineral water if possible both infections are acquired after a contaminated food or water see me after labs and earlier if any further concern,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

my hair is thinning out with excess hairball how to fix my problem,hi from the information given it seems you are experiencing the early signs of male pattern hair loss this is a very common condition and there are many factors responsible one of them being genetic if you have other family members with similar patterned hair loss the chances for you to develop it increase too due to the effect of the male hormone on the hair cycle over a period of time the hair follicle starts shrinking and so the hair which comes out is thinner and more fragile and breaks easily also the growing phase of the hair is shortened so your hair does not grow as long it used to and becomes shorter and wispier being just 17 years old I am sure it must be worrying you a lot but do not be disheartened there are several treatment options available and the sooner we start the treatment the better the chances of reducing further hair loss thinning and increasing regrowth a combination of oral supplements to boost hair growth along with application of lotions containing minoxidil to begin with will be the best course of action in my opinion oral finasteride which is the male hormone blocker is used frequently applications with finasteride are available too this will be prescribed by your treating doctor after assessing the extent of thinning and discussing the side effects etc several preparations of bio peptides and other natural ingredients like saw palmetto extract melatonin etc are also available to boost the hair growth pop platelet rich plasma is a popular procedure which is often used in combination with medical treatment to stimulate hair growth further usually a combination of treatments is suggested after the clinical evaluation but using the applications regularly is the key to good results hair regrowth takes a few months to show and you will have to be patient to see the benefit of the treatment I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

how will melatonin interact with the effect of birth control pills,hello I understand your concern here and you are right that there are not many or in fact hardly any articles or peer reviewed papers on melatonin and birth control interactions but I would like to keep it simple for you to understand melatonin is produced during the night to ease the sleep pattern in humans post sunset with maximum levels at am and by morning am the levels found are almost negligible so it is produced by the pineal gland in the dark cycle and metabolized at night by the liver now liver also is known to metabolize the birth control pills be it progesterone only or combinations pills hence if taken together then there is a likelihood of slower metabolism of either compound and thereby prolonged residual effect may be seen on concurrent use of pills and melatonin together the effects could be prolonged sleepiness and also melatonin induced increased progesterone levels in the body causing bloating and noticeable progestogenic side effects however the efficacy or effectiveness of the pill is not compromised but metabolism is delayed as melatonin competes with the pill with the liver so ideally the better way would be to switch the pop in the morning hours and the melatonin pill at night 12 hours apart this would prevent any interference with either action on the body or cause any interaction,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

my ekg reading shows sinus arrythmia kindly advise,hello your egg is fine and sinus arrhythmia is normal phenomenon where heart range varies with respiration it may not be evident always or depends on sensitivity of machine and also it is more pronounced detectable when one is breathing heavily or rapidly so it is not a matter of worry at all next thing were you also having palpitations when egg was taken or subsided by that time because considering symptoms of palpitations and chest discomfort its important to rule out possibility of cardiac arrhythmias like psvt paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which are intermittent and egg would be absolutely normal at other time so normal egg does not rule out possibility of arrhythmia so you should either have hotter monitoring 24 hour egg monitoring but it would detect arrhythmia only if it happened during this 24 hour period or you can buy simple single lead egg devices which would help to monitor your rhythm whenever you are symptomatic so basically we need an egg rhythm during symptoms so as to reliably rule out possibility of cardiac arrhythmia in a nutshell your egg is fine and may need further steps I would also like to know why are you eliquis prednisone and thyearoid problems may cause arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation so ash should be monitored,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

I have abdominal discomfort with it showing lot of stools in bowel please help,hello I can imagine your reason of concern for such ongoing on and off symptoms well first of all if it were ulcerative or crohn disease it should have shown something abnormal on it scan which I presume it did not however remember the it scan reporting is completely a subjective thing it depends highly on the expertise of radiologist who has reported that I would urge if you upload the report in reply to this response I would be glad to see that there will be no charges for that I will allow you one free follow up now the presence of too many stools is not an uncommon finding on it scan since it is basically the function of the colon to reserve stools transit them timely in anterograde direction and finally to be evacuated through the rectum and anal canal if the presence of stool with dilation of the lumen of colon or presence of stools within small bowel fecalization of small bowel and or dilation of the lumen of small bowel suggest an alarming finding normally our small bowel does not usually contain stools it rapidly empties matter to in to large bowel hence the presence of stool in small bowel suggests an abnormal finding I will tell you why this information on it scan is important for example you have a normal size of the lumen of bowel ideally less than am of small bowel and less than am of large bowel with the symptoms you mention it can be irritable bowel syndrome with constipation if the diameter of the lumen is above the normal it can be functional constipation of which two further types the one is chronic colonic constipation or colonic pseudo obstruction called as ogilvie syndrome the other where the small bowel is dilated called chronic small bowel pseudo obstruction I hope you now have an idea why it is important to correlate symptoms with the it scan findings now coming to your symptoms the pain or discomfort is often common when bowel loops are distended with gas or stools and your discomfort which readily resolves after you have good bowel movements suggest the possibility of the same and not otherwise due to a serious underlying cause the intensity of discomfort that changes with the bowel movement again suggests it might secondary to irritable bowel syndrome is metamucil is fiber laxative and really it does not have any harm if taken for years and years the fiber is nonabsorbale molecule it does not go into blood circulation so have no side effects however in some it can cause bloating or belching you can switch to other fibers such as fibrocol if metamucil does not suit you otherwise it is completely normal if you want to resume the same take plenty of water it makes stool bulk large and soft and easy to pass I myself have a habit of taking liters of water in a day and this really makes wonder you should continue that I would wait for your it scan report to see the findings then I will right you some investigations to rule out other possibilities I believe you would not have anyone but just to be on the safe side,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

my year old kid is having high fever for the past days can high abc be the cause,hi whenever we suffer an infection our body immune mechanism comes into action those immune cells are nothing but wbcs white blood corpuscles so if the wbcs are high then either there is an infection or the body is trying to fight bad cells in the body wbcs are not the cause of infection but it can cause fever by its actions so whenever someone has a fever it is very likely that they also have a high abc count there are different types of wbcs which increase decrease in different situations so the aim of doing blood tests is to see if only one type of wbcs are involved or there are multiple increased cell lines our diagnosis depends heavily on which type of wbcs are increased so please put up the babys blood sample reports,"Sorry, I didnt get you"
is it normal to get sharp shooting chest pain with increased heart rate in a patient with ar,hello firstly it is a moderate to severe ar aortic regurgitation with normal heart function and normal la dimension so there is no significant damage to the heart and also since you do not have symptoms of aortic regurgitation like palpitations or shortness of breath with exertion serial monitoring with echo would be enough now regarding chest pain it is unlikely to be cardiac it is likely related to acid reflux which is diluted by drinking water so you may have some antacid medications like rabeprazole domperidone or pantoprazole and domperidone combination before breakfast for few days you should also avoid spicy oily and hot foods as much as possible have light meals and walk for sometime after meals rather than resting immediately avoid too much tea or avoid caffeinated drinks now regarding heart rate it is unusual for heart rate to go up this much with simple walking however with running it is expected also one would certainly feel palpitations at this high heart rate and arrhythmic tachycardia would have other associated symptoms like dizziness shortness of breath chest pain etc so it is probably an artefact which is read as heartbeat by watch it is better if you can wear a watch which also shows egg tracings to confirm it or have 24 hour hotter monitoring to confirm it amtas is for blood pressure not to control heartbeat so if your blood pressure is elevated then you may have it so in a nutshell it is probably artefactual rather true tachycardia as it is unlikely for the heart rate to go above 150 with just walking however if one is too breathless during walking or has severe low hemoglobin or hyperthyearoidism with baseline elevated heart rate of more than 100 bum then it may or otherwise not I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

I had three anxiety attacks last night because of ringing sound in my ears please help,hello first of all please know that ringing sensation is very common and prevalent there are many suspected causes for ringing sensation in the ear the most common ones being wax impinging on the ear drum sudden loud noise moving into a quiet room from a noisy environment and so on you say it started after a bath even water soap hair follicles within your ear when come in contact with the ear drum can cause such ringing sensation although for a short duration this might have even attracted your attention to a symptom which might have been there even before but was not noticeable sometimes the medications you are on also can cause this ringing sensation to be honest there are lots of causes but no sure way of evaluating it so my suggestion try diverting your thoughts away from this and try concentrating on some other work when your thoughts are deeply immersed in something else you will realise that you can hear the ringing sensation only if you think about it you can also listen to music with ear phones with the volume of your device between 30 60 to get your mind off it but please do not do this all day give a gap of atleast an hour after listening for about 30 minutes also it will probably not bother you when you are involved in a conversation with somebody keeping your mind off it all said there are certain rare causes also which require systematic treatment but I would not want you to worry about them right away this symptom of yours has started all of a sudden and in all probability might disappear spontaneously as well do not get anxious reading about all the causes of ringing sensation on the internet as it is bound to frighten you try the above methods and tell me after 24 hours if there was any improvement at all,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

I have sinusitis with polyp in right maxillary sinus please help,hi we have to first ascertain as to why sinusitis has occurred in the first place usually in most cases the primary cause is a seasonal or year around allergic problem that is there just to make you understand I have tried to explain things in a simple way below exposure to dust or any irritative substance that your body is hypersensitive to will initially initiate reflexes such as sneezing to remove the offending agent out but if this fails mucosal cells in you nose start to hyperfunction producing loads of mucus to trap dust owing to its sticky nature this mucus has no where to go other than either being blown out of due to mucociliary activity gets pushed into the throat thereby entering into a new zone the throat initially reacts by activating cough impulses to push out the mucus but if that fails a local inflammation around the throat starts which often leads to symptoms such as feeling of a lump in the throat and repeated feeling to clear the throat as far as your nose is concerned due to long standing inflammation the mucosa starts to get edematous and ends up forming a polyp I know the problem is there since a long five years but I am not sure if you have followed any specific treatment chart which is usually recommended before we consider any patient for surgery this treatment chart is custom made according to your symptoms and does follow the guidelines to treat both allergy with sinusitis the following things can be considered wear an n95 mask at all times do not allow any dust or irritative substance from entering into your nose this is the most important thing you should be following failing which no treatment will bring any relief tablet sinarest paracetamol phenylephrine hydrochloride chlorpheniramine maleate one tablet twice daily after food 12 hours apart for 15 days tablet allegra fexofenadine and montelukast one tablet twice daily after food 12 hours apart for 15 days tablet zerodol the aceclofenac and thiocolchicoside 4mg or its equivalent one tablet twice daily after food for five days tablet clarithromycin 500 my one tablet twice daily after food duonase nasal spray or its equivalent two puffs two times a day in both nostrils for three months do not inhale while you spray the drug tablet mucomix 600 my acetylcysteine one tablet twice daily for week tablet wysolone prednisolone 10 my one tablet after breakfast for 10 days steam inhalation to times a day 10 saltwater gargles at to 10 times a day for one month do not smoke or consume alcohol as it slows down mucociliary clearance mechanisms all precautionary measures have to be followed strictly for maximum relief otherwise medications would not be useful on the long term surgery can be considered if above medications and precautionary measures do not give any relief but there is a catch to it the symptoms might come back sometimes even on a higher scale after a brief relief following surgery if the precautionary measures post surgery are not followed ideally speaking in a nutshell I again emphasis on preventing any irritative substance from entering the nose and throat thereby triggering an allergic cascade of events and reproducing the symptoms you have mentioned above as far as the polyp is concerned in very few cases the polyp resolves on its own with medications and often the patient requires a surgery called functional endoscopic sinus surgery where the sinus openings are widened and the polyps are removed you will have to get a it scan done to see the extent of the polyp current condition of the other sinuses and anatomical variations in the nose which could have been contributing to the polyp I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

what causes fluid in abdomen with back pain and low be in a hepatitis patient,hello I can understand you must be very upset about your father health form history and medication history it seems he has liver cirrhosis in other words it is called scarring of liver shrunken liver or chronic liver disease well the medications he is on and recent history of tapping of abdominal water suggest he has advanced disease which require a close follow up and listing such patient on liver transplantation the liver transplantation is the only definite therapy for advanced liver scarring such as in your father case but it is required to assign liver transplantation not too early and neither too late there are some scoring that should be performed before recommending liver transplant the one such score require blood investigations radiological test such as contrast enhanced it scan the reason why you do not see any improvement even after months of treatment is that all treatment is just supportive and does not correct underlying problem within liver except entaliv which is used for suppression of hepatitis infection to correct underlying liver it is liver transplantation which could help the survival are good after liver transplantation such as on average 70 individuals survive at years after successful transplant I want you to share me the complete blood investigations and tests that have been done as I can be able to stage his disease and give you reasonable approach to the problem chronic liver disease hepatitis related follow up to provide more information and investigations,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

I have bowel pain with negative calprotectin and lactoferrin tests why,hello I can understand you must be very upset about your ill health so the comprehensive stool analysis is well within normal limits particularly calprotectin and lactoferrin which are inflammatory markers their absence theoretically excludes any inflammation within the bowel hence a good finding the me examination and its reporting is a subjective findings means it is interpreted by a radiologist and may sometime have an error in reporting because of differential enhancement pattern within bowel and bowel movements at the time of scan plus given your colonoscopy report afterward also showed no pathology suggest it was possibly an error in interpretation the colonoscopy is however the best morality to explain the me magnetic resonance electrography reported findings given normal colonoscopy suggest that the possibility of inflammation is unlikely now coming to your symptoms and use of medication that you believe helped for some time from your history I understand you have been given mesalamine for the duration of seven months after a colonoscopy that showed colitis and biopsy showed non specific inflammation so first of all mesalamine is an anti inflammatory drug which is commonly being given among patient suffering from inflammatory bowel disease i'd the i'd is further classified into ulcerative colitis uc which is a superficial inflammation usually of large bowel starting down from rectum and goes above to involve large bowel the other one is crohn disease cd which is somewhat deeper inflammation of the gut wall having a tendency to involve almost every part of the gut starting from the mouth toward the anus given your symptoms of mucus or pus discharge and presence of pancolitis on one of your colonoscopy make me think that there is a possibility of ulcerative colitis plus the response you observed to mesalamine is also favoring this diagnosis your second colonoscopy did not show any inflammation possibly because of the remission of the disease the uc tend to have an intermittent course with flares and intervening remissions possibly at the time of second colonoscopy the disease was in remission given your recent stool test and recent normal colonoscopy make me think that you do not have active disease at the moment your disease seems to be controlled with budesonide or previous mesalamine you took the mucus pus discharge suggests that there may be some other problem such as anal fissure anal fistula or anal sinus which may accompany the ulcerative colitis in its course for this I want you to examine your perianal bottom area and see from where exactly the mucus is coming the abdominal pain may be just because of stress and anxiety accompanying the current situation and not necessarily the active disease for such pain sari selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are helpful for treatment I need to have the biopsy report of your colon both the previous one and recent one as I can see there is ongoing microscopic inflammation budesonide is an expensive drug and it is recommended in uc where the inflammation does not go beyond the left side of the colon you had pan colitis inflammation involving the whole colon and that is why oral steroids such as tablet prednisolone is more effective than budesonide the physician prescribes budesonide over oral prednisolone if the patient is unable to tolerate the systemic side effects which accompany oral prednisolone or patient has diabetes and bone mineral deficiency your physician probably kept this thing in mind so to summarize you likely have ulcerative colitis because I did not see biopsy of your bowel and as you said it was nonspecific the uc is in remission the pus and mucus have to be closely examined by you or by a physician by doing a digital rectal examination the uc can frequently accompany depression and anxiety and that should be taken care of abdominal pain possibly related to stress and you consider taking sari at minimum dose like tablet escitalopram 10 my daily discuss with your primary gastroenterologist regarding oral prednisolone if he is convinced enough you may share your biopsy reports I can advise you on this as well one more thing since you do not have any sign suggestive of active disease the steroid are not required at the moment you need to be given some immunosuppressive medications to control and prevent relapse flare the one more reason for your doctor prescribed budesonide is he might have considered microscopic colitis which is entirely a different diagnosis and requires entirely a different management approach you share me the biopsy and colonoscopy reports that will make me in a good position to tell you what to do now and sorry for such a huge description and lengthy message but I am sure this will really help you to understand your condition I hope this helps ulcerative colitis in remission done already need biopsy reports of both colonoscopies also images of both colonoscopies crohn colitis ulcerative colitis follow up with biopsy report,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

I have 10 spots on penis for a long duration with no harm is it sad,hello this was likely a wart only warts can have very varied morphology and most plausible explanation is for wart only because considering it was a single lesion was not painful or itchy flesh colored and it persisted for a long time and resolved on its own so all these factors favor it morphology can be variable the negative factor was not sexually active although most common causes are sexual contacts but significant number of individuals may have it with non sexual contacts as well it can be transmitted vertically during childbirth and remain dormant for a long time activating later in life it can be transmitted with usual contacts and can be transmitted through clothing like underwear if came in direct or indirect contact with infected individual clothing sharing toilets etc can also transmit it so being not sexually active is not a strong factor against it rest all causes like skin tags which would persist without treatment or fall off suddenly up pearly penile papeles would be numerous papeles other infectious causes would be short lived and multiple lesions and symptomatic like painful tender or red malignancies are unlikely at this age and would progress so the probability is high for wart only I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

my persistent heartburn has not healed even after taking medicines for more than month why,hello you have briefly and well described your history and I understand that you have very genuine concerns so the problem you have is called gastroesophageal reflux disease herd this is basically reflux of acid from the stomach to food pipe causing heartburn sore throat sometimes cough and shortness of breath our stomach produces approximately liter of acidic juices to help digest food the acid produced does not usually come into food pipe unless someone has loose sphincter at the lower end of our food pipe which prevents acid refluxing into the food pipe there are two further classifications of herd pi responsive herd and pi refractory herd your symptoms suggest that you have pi proton pump inhibitor responsive herd since your symptoms are significantly improved when you are taking pi even in pi responsive herd the symptoms may not completely vanish but are declined to a reasonable level and this may be in your case for this you just need to increase the dose of pi instead of once daily dose you can start taking it twice a day before meals the rest of your symptoms like sore throat will go away once your acid reflux is suppressed well diet may or may not affect the herd however there are certain precautions that you can do to prevent heartburn avoiding large volume meals instead take small but frequent meals avoid taking large meals at night or before going to bed give at least three to four hours gap after night meals before going to bed for sleeping raise the head end of your bed by placing a cement or wooden block down the head side of your bed or there are commercially available anti reflux mattresses that can be used instead avoid wearing tight fitting clothes and belts so your concern about the presence of symptoms despite 42 days of treatment is valid but you see the acid is produced daily and the medicines can decrease the acid production for the duration of time they are in the blood once the level of the drug declines from a certain point the acid production takes over back so taking a daily pill to control your acid production is the only effective way of treating your condition no long term use and side effects well all pi are relatively safe and do not cause significant side effects if taken for years and years however there are studies that have shown renal damage bone protein loss and aspiration pneumonia but in practice these side effects are not that common as elaborated in studies the one daily pill to control your acid and prevailing a normal lifestyle is much more important than unforeseen and often unestablished side effects from long term use of pi I would recommend if pi helps you to do well then there is no reason for stopping for the sake of unforeseen complications but if you still have a concern about the long use of pi then I would recommend you to get oh impedance 24 hours testing to confirm herd and if present then pi again is the therapy but if the test comes out negative then pi can be stopped I hope this helps pi responsive herd ambulatory 24 hours oh impedance testing non erosive reflux disease herd tablet pantoprazole 40 my before breakfast you can increase it to 40 my bid before meals follow up if want to discuss more,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

I took clavulin for frontal sinusitis but still feel pressure on top of my head why,hi apologies for the late reply as you have rightly put it the most probable problem out there is a severe allergic problem with an associated sinusitis frontal sinusitis to be precise I have tried to explain things in a very simple yet precise manner below the cascade of events is explained in a very simple manner below eventhough its not as simple as it looks exposure to dust or any irritative substance that your body is hyper sensitive to will initially initiate reflexes such as sneezing to remove the offending agent out but if this fails mucosal cells in you nose start to hyperfunction producing loads of mucus to trap dust owing to its sticky nature this mucus has no where to go other than either being blown out of due to mucociliary activity gets pushed into the throat thereby entering into a new zone the throat initially reacts by activating cough impulses to push out the mucus but if that fails a local inflammation around the throat starts which often leads to symptoms such as feeling of a lump in the throat and repeated feeling to clear the throat now this is general cascade that usually occurs in most people but need not be specific to you sinusitis is always secondary to something allergy being the most common out of them there could be other reasons as well for sinusitis to occur such as a hypoplastic frontal sinus narrow frontal outflow tract frontal recess sinonasal polyposis etc another important fact about sinusitis is about its recurrence plain use of antibiotics does not solve the issue but just keeps it off for a while we need to dig down and see what has caused the sinusitis in the first place for appropriate treatment rather than superficially treating it with plain antibiotics precautionary measures is one such thing which if followed such as in a case or allergy will definetely go a very long way in keeping the problem at bay the requirement of medications also will be less and on the whole you will have immense benefit you can consider the following advice all precautionary measures have to be followed strictly for maximum relief other wise medications will not be useful on long term if things do not seem ok even after following the treatment schedule mentioned above a non contrast it is mandatory to find out what exactly could be going on in the sinonasal region anatomical variations extent of inflammatory load are few things we look into while reading a it scan surgery can be considered if above medications and precautionary measures do not give any relief but there is a catch to it the symptoms might come back sometimes even on a higher scale after a brief relief following surgery if the precautionary measures post surgery are not followed ideally speaking in a nut shell I again emphasis on preventing any irritative substance from entering the nose and throat thereby triggering an allergic cascade of events and reproducing the symptoms you have mentioned above I hope I have answered to your query in detail sorry again for the late reply get well soon warm regards,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

my nose is stuffy and I have headaches is it a chronic sinus infection,hi looks like your having a chronic allergic problem out there now there are certain things which have to be understood in detail allergic rhinitis is an immune complex issue which is innately present and starts showing symptoms at one particular age it basically is a hyper responsiveness to something which is foreign and has accidentally entered into you nose causing cascade of chemical events leading to nasal congestion watery nasal discharge sneezing itching in eye and nose fullness in the ear and often leads to sinusitis causing heaviness in the area of your face involving the frontal and maxillary regions besides your nose antibiotics has a limited role here unless it is an infection that we are treating you have to wear a n95 mask and not allow the triggering factor to enter into your nose in the first place trigerring factors range from dust pollen animal fur fumes strong odours etc and the list is endless allowing the triggering problem to keep entering your nose is just going to prolong the problem through life and no medication will ever be effective nasal steroid sprays have definelty a role to play I usually suggest a combination of a topical steroid such as fluticasone propionate along with a antihistamine such as azelastine hydrochloride puffs in each nostril times a day 12 his apart for months straight certain antiallergics containing fexofenadien 120mg one tab two times a day 12hrs apart for 20 days is effective antibiotics like clarithromycin 500 my twice a day if taken have to used for long months to be extremely effective I give clarithromycin for both its antibiotic and immunomodulatory activity later of which is more important salt water gargles to 10 times a day for 10 days sipping on warm water steam inhalation avoiding cold spicy and oily junk food goes a long way smoking and alcohol to be completely avoided as it slows down the mucociliary activity and leads to secretions inside your nose causing a severe sinusitis and its related problems hope this advice helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

my father lose his conscious when he holds back his sneeze what to do,hi first we need to find out what is the cause of recurrent sneezing if you look into the physiology sneeze is a protective reflex often in response to something irritative and offensive which the body wants to push out in order to prevent it from reaching the lungs and thereby into the circulation most commonly it is dust but can be attributed to other irritative substances such as animal fur pollen smoke fumes etc what can be done prevention of entry of irritative substances is the key and plays a major role in preventing allergic responses this can be effectively done by wearing an n95 mask most times even while indoors in addition a combination of antihistaminic and asteroidal spray containing azelastine and fluticasone two puffs two times a day does wonder holding a sneeze inside can be lethal as it is high pressure reflux and by holding the sneeze reverse pressure can be created which has no where else to go but above to the cranium thereby an increase in intracranial pressure causing a vessel to rupture resulting in a stroke this is a far possibility but in elderly individuals it can happen and is lethal secondly an increase in intrathoracic pressure can also stimulate the vagus nerve resulting in vasovagal syncope causing a brief loss of consciousness it is very important that these measures are followed in order to prevent any untoward incident I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

why do I feel like a muscle gets pulled when I lift the left side of my lip,hello your description of your symptoms sounds a bit strange to me but if your lip moves involuntarily then you may have muscle twitching due to too much caffeine if you drink a lot of coffee but there are also other less common causes if you have tingling this could be an early sign of recurrent herpes infection though it lasts only a few days before the vehicles start to appear and one week is a long time there may also be a spasm in your lip muscles so try hot pads on your lip for starters to relax the muscle and if you take a lot of caffeine reduce your consumption and eat foods rich in potassium like banana if you start to feel tingling or see any redness in that area you may need to consult a doctor an oral medicine specialist or dermatologist for an antiviral prescription there are other rare possibilities that may be the reason behind your symptoms but as they are uncommon I would not worry about them at the moment having said that I suggest seeking further medical attention if you do not improve after a few days,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

I have pain in my lower left back tooth and medicines are not helping me why,hello I have gone through your query and understood your concern unfortunately taking medicines is not a permanent solution to dental pain there are several factors that cause dental pain and associated headache the most common cause is tooth decay however a clear clinical picture or an ray will help determine what is causing your pain when decay reaches the nerve of the tooth it starts to give out symptoms the nerve which supplies the tooth also supplies that side of the face hence the referred associated pain taking painkillers will help control the pain to some extent but it does nothing to cure the decay it can only be manually treated by removing them you may require an ray procedure to determine the extent of the decay and if the nerve of the tooth is involved a root canal treatment is generally done to remove infections and decay since it is the time of the pandemic dentists are providing emergency care only and some dentists prefer telephonic consultation prior to dental visit and treatment if the pain is unbearable even after taking medicines it is best to call up a dentist providing emergency care and get it treated I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

I had root canal and received temporary crown can I do self cementing of permanent crown,hello I have gone through your query and understand your concern firstly going without a permanent crown but with a temporary crown in place does not going to cause any serious complications to make this more clear I would like to explain the need for a permanent crown after a root canal treatment once the tooth is root canal treated and the infected pulp tissues removed the tooth becomes dehydrated and is more prone to fractures or chip offs and secondary infections if left uncovered the tooth is ideally shaped and reduced to receive a crown so going without a crown could actually lead to sutra eruption of the opposing tooth so a root canal tooth has to be covered with some sort of crown to prevent chip offs secondary infections and sutra eruption generally a ceramic or a zirconia crown which can withstand our enormous biting force is installed to protect the underlying tooth since the fabrication of such a crown takes time a temporary or a little less hard crown is installed meanwhile this can withstand and stay in place for a couple of weeks depends on the crown and cement material but if on following certain instructions you can expect it to come a little extra longer than that maybe a couple of months avoid biting hard and chewy foods hard foods can cause the temporary crown to crack and chewy and sticky foods tend to dislodge the crown fruit seeds nuts chewing gum cheesy foods burgers etc brush gently and skip flossing for that tooth keep your permanent crown safe probably after a couple of months let us hope the situation gets fine and you can get it fixed safely please do follow these and let us expect it to come a little longer let this pandemic settle and you can get the permanent crown fixed right away and it is not advisable to do an at home permanent crown fixing procedure because permanent crowns are strong and are not malleable and adaptable so if fixed in a very slightly different way could change your bite and cause jaw issues and tooth pain sometimes at the doctor office the permanent crowns will be adjusted and refinished a little before fixing to bring a proper and stable bite so fixing at home is not a good idea and just in case if this temporary crown decements by accident do not worry this is not going to cause serious trouble in the future I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

is it necessary to take ecospirin during second pregnancy when the first one was normal,hi I have seen the report now every laboratory has its own calculation methods to come to a risk ratio after the test hug and papp a levels are also different at different times of pregnancy and also has some effects of weight and age on it this is a genetic screening test and we do this test to find out what is the risk of this pregnancy having a congenital abnormal baby specifically downs edward turner and patau syndromes this risk ratio has cut off values means trisomy 21 downs has a risk ratio of 365 in your case and cut off is 250 now with this report we are calculating the risk of having a baby with downs syndrome is in 365 pregnancy with your age and with the test and ultrasound reports you have we are calculating the risk and the report is always low risk or high risk there is never no risk practically also after doing all available tests we never can rule out all the possible abnormalities in the baby cos chorionic villas sampling and sometimes amniocentesis are 100 if they found baby dna in the procedure to rule out that the baby does not have trisomy 21 or other major chromosomal anomalies that does not mean all genetic abnormalities are ruled out both of these procedures also have some risk of abortion during or after and that is why we advise these test in high risk double marker nip non invasive prenatal testing is also a screening test like double marker but the test is less risky as compared to cos and amniocentesis but at the same time more costly and test sensitivity to rule out trisomy 21 and other is 99 after all these details you must be confused now other trisomies are definitely low risk but in case of trisomy 21 your report is 365 and which is somewhat near cut off 250 ideally I advise further testing of cos and amniocentesis if the value is below cut off value but 365 is also near the cut off value so it is a debatable issue 365 means that out of 365 pregnancy 364 will be normal and pregnancy will have trisomy 21 secondly you can start ecosprin tablets we usually start it in some high risk patients if you have pregnancy after 30 years then you come under high risk group so you should start it in cos there is chance of bleeding inside and that is why your gynecologist does not ask to start it if you are going for cos and every pregnancy is different and we cannot say that if previous pregnancy did not have any problem nor the baby has any problem then this pregnancy will not have anything wrong yes we can say that if previous pregnancy was normal then there is somewhat more chance that this pregnancy will also normal go through all details two or three times to understand it properly and then ask anything if you have more questions I hope this helps I am not able to open it scan report yes but the second report is saying that it is 93 and nasal bone is seen mostly these two sonography markers are also used to calculate the risk in double marker apart from hug beta human chorionic gonadotropin and papp a pregnancy associated plasma protein a both it nuchal translucency and no nasal bone are normal,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

when will the cognitive function get back to normal after sports concussion,hi I can completely understand your concern for your daughter illness I have seen the attachment sports concussion injury is a new concept in medical sciences concussion is basically a very mild injury to the brain which impairs the basic mechanism in which a brain functions under normal circumstances concussion can be caused by a direct blow to the head or by indirect blow for example when an athlete is sprinting very fast and suddenly stops or changes direction leading to the sudden change in movement of the brain tissue leading to a friction between the brain tissue and inner surface of the bones of the skull let us discuss the queries asked by you one by one regarding how can her cognitive function be back to normal when she still feels so bad well at present her problem is not concussion brain injury because concussion brain injuries usually heals within a few days various scientific studies shows that 90 95 of concussion injuries heals as fast as within eight to nine days after the injury and only 10 injuries take more than 10 days so medically and technically it is post concussion syndrome which she is presently dealing with post concussion syndrome can develop in a person with a very mild concussion and on the contrary do not develop in some patients who suffered a major injury which in turn means that development of post concussion syndrome does not depend on the severity of brain injury it happens in some and do not happen in others but the good thing is that in sooner or later the person gets cured with time 90 cases of post concussion syndrome resolves in two to three months and 10 resolves six to eight months after the initial injury and very rarely it may take maximum unto one year but the point is that almost 100 cases get resolved maximally within one year after the injury regarding does she need to continue to rest as she has been for four months yes as she is still having symptoms of post concussion syndrome I headache fatigue dizziness sleeping disturbances etc she needs to continue both physical and mental rest till all the symptoms go away the medical reason behind recommending both mental and physical reasons is that doing physical activity the heart starts beating fast and more forcefully leading to increased blood flow in the brain which intern can exacerbate the symptoms of post concussion syndrome and can cause the symptoms to reoccur similarly performing cognitive activity and even mental activities like thinking use energy in the brain and can slow the recovery process of post concussion syndrome regarding does she still have a concussion no she does not have concussion now as I have already explained that in almost all cases concussion injury heals within 10 days her primary concussion injury has healed and presently she only has the symptoms of post concussion syndrome regarding her special accommodations at school right now yes she should continue and follow those special accommodations till all her symptoms of post concussion syndrome subside and go away otherwise as I explained above any physical or mental stress can delay the recovery and can re trigger the symptoms repeatedly I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

why do my creatinine and bun levels remain fluctuating on dialysis,hello I have worked as a chief in a hemodialysis center for 20 months once the kidneys have failed and the patient is hooked up on dialysis the creatinine value is always high at this time we do not care about the creatinine values because once we start dialysis on a patient it is assumed that his kidneys have incurred permanent damage and he cannot come back to normalcy at this juncture we use the patient creatinine value as a measure of protein intake if a dialyzing patient creatinine value is high it is assumed that he is having good protein intake through diet and high creatinine value is desirable in dialysis patients since intake of much proteins gives them a long life when creatinine value drops we start worrying that the patient is not taking much proteins so the drop in your creatinine value may be because you have started taking less proteins than usual in this situation we advise you to take more protein containing foods for a dialyzing patient the most important parameter is blood urea see what is your blood urea level before and after a single dialysis session ideally there should be a 60 reduction then it can be comfortably assumed that dialysis is effective if you do not achieve this reduction complain to the dialysis technician he will do the needful adjustments with the machine the big factor we have to afraid of is potassium it should never cross I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

how to treat recent bout of insomnia caused due to stress,hi you have a unique situation and though I do not have a clear answer to your complaints I can give you some relevant advice the first thing to do is to evaluate your insomnia I would suggest you use a camera to video record your sleep you can use your phone camera with good memory capacity and place it somewhere higher so you can see your movements at bedtime the reason for this is that personal evaluation of one own sleep is far from objective I frequently come across patients who say that they cannot sleep while their partners say they do and occasionally even snore there are phone applications like sleep as android etc which record your movements in bed and can give you a reasonable estimate of your sleep time another possibility is that you are sleeping but not getting enough deep sleep deep sleep is characterized by slow waves on eg electroencephalography and the feeling of having rested during sleep that is why sleep study is the ideal investigation for sleep issues as it does an eg recording as well as a video recording of your sleep as android also gives a rough estimate of your deep sleep percentage during your entire sleep in such a scenario there are specific medications which enhance deep sleep like pregabalin which you can ask your doctor about sometimes trying too hard to sleep is counter productive beliefs like I should get seven hours of sleep at any cost and if I do not it will cause great harm to my mind and body are incorrect and very likely to impair with sleep these irrational thoughts need to be addressed via cognitive behavioral therapy if you think this could be the problem with you the most important component of sleep hygiene is if you cannot sleep leave the bedroom sit somewhere else and do stuff like reading or listening to music this breaks the classical conditioning association between your bed and inability to sleep go to bed only when you feel sleepy remember that the use of electronic displays in the late evening could be a major cause of insomnia keep their use to minimum and use a blue light filter app on your phone after evening try taking natural sleep promoters like melatonin 6 my which you can find on the internet this should give you some guidelines to investigate into your sleep and hopefully improve it,"Sorry, I didnt get you"
what is the treatment for chronic bronchitis with fever horrible cough and shortness of breathe,hello in many cases of chronic bronchitis acute symptoms appear due to infection so I would advise in such a scenario to get a hemogram with ear erythrocyte sedimentation rate and chest ray done if the chest ray and these blood investigations show no sign of infection then you would be treated for bronchitis treatment constitutes antiallergic drugs like levocetirizine and montelukast and in severe cases inhalers containing like salbutamol and steroid inhaler like budenoside in case of severe spasm and coughing a steroid like prednisolone can be used for a short course after being sure that there is no active infection or pneumonia if you do not have a severe cough or respiratory distress and your chest if found clear on examination then a cough syearup containing salbutamol levocetirizine dextromethorphan will help you greatly benzonatate pearls are helpful in an allergic cough only as they just anesthetize the throat and reduce the allergic cough response but in cases of severe chest congestion they are not useful also do steam inhalation for symptomatic relief I would advise you to see your doctor and get investigated share my opinion with him I am sure he would agree to it and would prescribe you accordingly I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

my brother is affected with chickenpox will my pregnant wife get the infection soon,hello I have seen the report I can understand your concern I will answer one by one as you told me it is ith week I would like to tell you that in the first 12 weeks the overall risk of transmitting infection to the child and development of severe disease in child is only 4 percent in your case the mother already has protective antibodies egg antibodies cutting down the risk further but still we do not want to risk the child whatever risk may be so I will advise for isolation of mother or patient until all the lesions of chickenpox get crusted because after they crust they get noninfectious the chance of getting chickenpox again in life is a rare phenomenon but at times if the immunity is low it may occur equivocal in the report means that the mother has protecting immunity against chickenpox but not very strong it would be strong if the levels were more than 12 but it is not negative that means the mother can fight some infection it is not very bad to get affected at this stage but if it happens near the delivery time or within five days of delivery then it is very bad right now even if she gets infected she will develop immunity and pass on to the baby some antiviral drugs can be given if infected but I do not think she requires it now and yes definitely until the invective stage of your brother and sister vanishes you should think of isolation,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

can an old man with partially injured cervical spinal cord able to walk without assistance,hello I read carefully your question and would explain that the cervical spinal cord is a very delicate part of the spinal cord because in its beginning are located the most important centers which control the heart rate the pulmonary function and the blood pressure values it is true that just after a trauma a man can walk with or without assistance for 50 meters and this can sound strange in fact this can be related to the lack of damage to the spinal cord in that moment there is only the fracture of the vertebral column while the central nervous system is intact while walking the instability of the damaged vertebral column causes further damage to the spinal cord and the person gets paralyzed regarding the partial and complete damage of the spinal cord it is difficult to judge all the damages begin as partial but because of the spinal cord instability the lack of right immobilization and the bleeding and swelling the damage may become complete in the next days the swelling and bleeding tend to spread and the spinal cord is trapped within the vertebral column and can not expand further so the swelling and bleeding cause further damage to the spinal cord it is difficult to judge in the first days of trauma but because of the swelling in the first days after the trauma first week the person may die because of acute cardio respiratory arrest due to the dysfunction of the heart and respiratory function the swelling tends to spread in the upper cord and the paralysis becomes complete affecting also the respiration and the heart rhythm I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

are bulging discs the worst symptom of fibromyalgia,hi I have read through your query in detail please find my observations below fibromyalgia is still a less understood illness with pain and discomfort involving muscles and bones and the main feature includes that it is puzzling or difficult to identify it is elusive and is a diagnosis the diagnosis is made on the elimination of known conditions which might cause similar symptoms after using standard diagnostic tests and investigations therefore if a patient is known to have bulging discs then it has to differ from fibromyalgia in other words you might have had fibromyalgia if there is no particular finding in the mri magnetic resonance imaging scan therefore it is important to document mri scan findings and then the diagnosis of fibromyalgia might be set aside and changed to include degenerative disc disease following the proof of bulging discs the problem is that probably earlier investigations have led your employers to believe that you have fibromyalgia however a single incident has changed things for you and they refuse to accept it the best way out will be to have evidence based medical diagnosis and take suggested treatment I agree that there is a lot of miscommunication about fibromyalgia and people with real problems are often labeled wrongly considering an earlier diagnosis which was made months to years back in conclusion fibromyalgia is not concerned with bulging discs and if your mri scan shows bulging discs which might be related to your pain and discomfort symptoms then you have the option of making a point with the workman comp authority hope this answers your question,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

I feel some pressure in neck after accidental strangulation is this a sign of hernia,hi sorry to hear about your injury since your it computed tomography scan is normal it is very unlikely that there is any bony or skeletal injury hence reducing the possibility of something permanent it appears that there is some soft tissue injury in the laryngopharyngeal region or a cartilaginous injury that is resolving very slowly this indicates an injury closer to the voice box region because of constant movements during speech laughter and swallowing delay recovery this may also explain why it is taking so long to heal completely in my opinion an mri magnetic resonance imaging is certainly indicated since there has been no improvement in symptoms for five weeks and to look for cartilaginous injury or soft tissue lesions such as a granuloma or hematoma following trauma in addition a video laryngoscope performed by an ent will help to evaluate the voice box and supporting apparatus internally for any injury specifically the inter arytenoid region a hernia in the neck or a laryngocele may be a possibility following neck injury but seems very unlikely in your case since there is no visible bulge in the neck which worsens on coughing etc there may be an internal laryngocele that may be picked up on video laryngoscope I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

is there a chance for dengue reattach in the same season,hello the fact that dengue cannot happen in the same season is true to some extent but not absolutely let me explain dengue is a viral infection caused by the bite of infected ages aegypti mosquito every mosquito bite will not lead to dengue fever as for infection to happen first the mosquito should be infected by the dengue virus dev by infection of the mosquito I mean the mosquito just serves as a vector or carrier for virus transfer to humans also every mosquito carrying the dengue virus would not lead to dengue fever shock etc some people just have subclinical asymptomatic infections too there are actually four types of dengue viruses numbered from to infection with one type followed by recovery confers immunity to that type of infection our body produces antibodies against the virus and protects us from further infection with time these antibodies fade away so immunity in dev is present but is short lived it can be said that the infection cannot occur in the same season but if an infection with another type say dev type followed by dev type occurs the body does not have antibodies which are protective against type as the body was previously infected by dev type this type of infection is more dangerous however in a season only one type of dev infection occurs usually I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"
what causes pain in the extracted tooth area with bone exposure that extends unto ear,hi I have read through your complaint and the relevant details and also saw the ray you have attached tooth number 19 seems to have a good apical seal in the root fillings the first dentist was right in saying that there is a space prepared for the post fixture there is one cusp missing in the tooth hence the treatment plan was a post and core followed by a crown the pain is definitely not because of this root canal treated tooth the reason behind this is that only poorly cleaned prepared or poorly filled roots retain the bugs to stay within the roots while deteriorating the tooth and give pain in your case the root fillings are excellent since you told you are not able to get a crown due to financial reasons at the moment the treatment plan could have been changed maybe at least the post could have been fixed leaving the crown fabrication at the last in that case at least the tooth stays stronger for a while and does not break off when you bite hard food next regarding the tooth extracted area you have mentioned that the bone is exposed now I doubt if you have got dry socket not to be mistaken for infection due to improper healing of the gums over there this might be the reason for the severe pain secondly tooth number 20 also has decay on the sides which makes me to advise you to get another ray for that tooth the current ray does not show the complete tooth this particular tooth might also be the reason for pain please do not worry that the infection spreads to the head there is no such possibility for that right now either 18 dry socket or 20 decay has to be addressed to help you get rid of the pain continue taking amoxicillin as prescribed and for pain relief you can switch to ibuprofen 400 my orally eight hourly for two days provided you do not have asthma or gastritis problems else continue narco tablet for two more days hence I advise you to visit back to the dentist and get done with further checkups as I mentioned above periapical ray for tooth number 20 to rule out interproximal cares pulpits in 20 saline irrigation and zinc oxide eugenol dressing for dry socket in 18 gargle mouth with lukewarm saltwater thrice daily for three days to flush out debris from the gums and in the extracted socket in case it not healed yet follow up after three weeks,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

received class and allergy for a few foods in rast can those foods cause anaphylaxis,hello welcome to icliniq com last is a highly accurate test if the test is positive for a specific allergen it shows that you are sensitized to that particular allergen this means that you may mount an allergic response when you are exposed to that allergen however it does not mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to that substance and nor does it mean that any reactions will be severe if the test is negative it means that one does not have the ability to mount an allergic reaction to that allergen and any symptoms one may be experiencing are probably not due to an allergic reaction to that substance however the results of the last need to be interpreted in conjunction with your clinical history g the presence of allergy to some or few allergens which may possibly be present either in the environment or food does not necessarily mean that they are responsible for the symptoms because if they are not even present in the environment or food of an individual then they are irrelevant in your case an elimination diet has not helped thus proving the fact that last test results should be carefully interpreted along with clinical history and does not necessarily mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to the substance that you tested angioedema is frequently associated with urticaria pathogenesis is the same for both urticaria as well as angioedema the presence of angioedema does not always mean that it is a part of anaphylaxis angioedema can be a part of anaphylaxis in those individuals who have a severe allergic reaction to an allergen with high levels of antibodies circulating in the blood since you have only class and level antibodies therefore it is unlike that these antigens or allergens would cause anaphylaxis,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

what is the best option other than braces to fill the gap of missing upper left canine,hi first of all I need to know your age the treatment plan varies according to the age factor secondly the impacted tooth no matter where it is it should be 100 removed this is done to reduce the possibility of complications in the future it cannot even form a cyst abscess etc because it is prone to infections only after the removal and depending on the remaining space restoration options are considered if you are young then braces option will give you the best result because it does not involve grinding of teeth plus it gives you a permanent result even though the time frame is more for the treatment it is worth it next is the bridge option here there is grinding of teeth on either side of the gap reliable but why do you want to unnecessarily grind the teeth which might make your teeth sensitive when the bridge fails in the long run then you got to fix it again double expense implant is a good option this depends on how sound is your jaw bone and for canines it is mostly not considered because of the difficulty in imitating the natural aesthetics for a detailed and customized treatment plan please visit your dentist and discuss the best option that suits your age and the quality of bone,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

is it safe to fly with eustachian tube dysfunction,hello though the history you have given is insufficient to come to any conclusion about the possible causes I will give information about the common conditions which can have such symptoms the most common cause for scratchy throat with hoarse voice is routine throat infections such as acute pharyngotonsillitis or acute laryngitis which usually resolves with simple antibiotics and mouth gargles the next common cause which can present similarly is reflux laryngopharyngitis which is a type of acidity related disorder in this condition constant reflux of digestive acid into the throat causes injury to taste buds vocal cords and throat which leads to symptoms such as change of voice and change in taste in general people with reflux laryngopharyngitis will have symptoms such as burning sensation in chest repeated burping chest tightness dryness of throat etc regarding your inner ear conditions super semicircular canal dehiscence is a rare inner ear condition in this condition there will be giddiness and imbalance when exposed to loud noise and echoing of once own voice etc this condition usually does not get worsened by the change in environmental pressure so air travel would not be an issue in this condition in any case keep anti vertigo medications such as stemetil handy when you fly patulous eustachian tube is a condition involving the middle ear and nose my guess is because of the similarity in symptoms you have given in both the diagnoses I can say that if there is vertigo then it is superior canal dehiscence if there is no vertigo chances of patulous eustachian tube are high in any case people with patulous eustachian tube will have a certain degree of pressure symptoms in ear when they fly but most of the time it would not be very severe you can use simple saline nasal spray before boarding the flight and every two hours in the air to reduce symptoms,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

I have a mild tender lump under the skin of the deltoid muscle is that sarcoma,hi I can understand the anxiety you would be suffering from after suspecting that it is a sarcoma here is what I can suggest to you sarcoma is an uncommon cause of such lumps and much more common are some harmless cysts and lipomas malignant tumors like sarcoma generally do not stay the same size for three years most malignant sarcoma in limbs are not associated with pain however there is only one way to find out for sure and that is doing some tests on this lump you have not mentioned the size of the lump if it is small for about 2 am in diameter then it may be possible to take it out and test for malignant cells thoroughly if it is larger then an mri scan and a needle core biopsy can be done to decide the treatment whether it can directly be taken out or not will be decided by the size and exact location of the lump please send a picture with a scale measure by the side of the lump if you want to follow up much more commonly however it is a cyst that can be easily taken out without any ill effects to know if it is a cyst or not your doctor needs to examine you and maybe do an ray of the limb and an ultrasound examination of the site but only if required for now do not worry just see a good surgeon most likely it is a lipoma or a cyst and not a tumor,"Sorry, I didnt get you"
why am I feeling wetness in the perianal area after some years of fistulotomy,hi after reviewing the information shared and your pictures a few things come to mind wetness in the perianal area and itching are because of the small amount of seepage of stools around the anus this stool causes irritation to the skin around the anus which causes the itch also the irritation can erode the skin and cause a blood drop to appear I would like to know a bit more regarding your problem did you have any pain along with the blood spot or any pain after stools how frequent is this problem of itching did you ever feel a small amount of stool or gas passed without your control while coughing or laughing hard when did it start happening did it start happening any time soon or was it there all along after surgery has it changed over time was it a normal delivery was anything done to assist the delivery was there any complication at the time of delivery of baby from the picture I can think of two possibilities there is a defect in your anal sphincter the contracting muscle although to be sure a thorough examination is required along with an ultrasound called trust transanal ultrasound a special type done from inside the anus in this case the trouble would be there all along after surgery so you may be right that it did not heal properly there might be a new fistula in ano developing just in front of the anal opening and behind the vaginal opening in this case it would have started troubling for a couple of months if it was painful for you to pass stools or associated with pain after passing stools then it could be an anal fissure my advice as follows do sit bath take lukewarm water in a tub and put a half teaspoon of ordinary salt in it now sit in this water and try to make the water clean and sooth your anal region sit for around 15 minutes three to four times every day try to do it at least twice per day it will decrease itching avoid constipation with a large platter of salad sprouts or sat isabgol spoonful three times per day take to liters of water measured by a bottle every day do exercises for building pelvic muscles and improving the tone or control of anal sphincter it is best to discuss all the above with your local doctor who can examine you in person as a definite diagnosis is unlikely without examination if there is a defect seen on trust and weakness of sphincter some surgical repair may be possible otherwise exercises can help kindly get back with the queries and follow up on icliniq thank you,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

is there any permanent cure for frequent bouts of respiratory infection in a kid,hello thanks for writing your query to me I can understand that you are very much concerned about the health of your son from your history description it seems that your son has bronchial asthma usually occurs from exposure to the allergens in our surrounding environment the main treatment of asthma is inhaler medicines like budecort inhaler 200 instead of giving him daily twice nebulizer I will recommend you to start him on budecort inhaler via zerostat vt spacer two puffs twice daily followed by gargling with water and levolin inhaler two puffs as required in an emergency on a long term basis inhaler medicines are not as harmful as they are having fewer side effects than tablets and syearups also as they act at the site of action a very minimal dose of medicine is required try to find out the allergens in his surroundings and avoid them as much as possible there is no need to deprive him of dairy products such as milk cheese or paneer unless he cannot tolerate them he needs to give it as it is the most important source of calcium and required for weight gain nebulization with budecort is only to be given when he is unable to take inhaler by mouth do not forget to rinse the mouth with water after taking inhaler or nebulizer no other therapy is better for optimal control of asthma as there is no cure for it homeotherapy also cannot cure asthma in the long run as there is no scientific evidence for it I hope everything is clear to you now,"Sorry, I didnt get you"
kindly explain whether diclofenac solution can affect the baby during pregnancy or not,hi you are in the last trimester 9 month of pregnancy most of the organs in the fetus might have developed and now it is growing thus care should be taken in food and lifestyle the rate of absorption of diclofenac solution into blood from skin is very less even if you apply the solution on your own body skin for long hours the absorption will be less if it is absorbed it stays in the blood for hours at the end of hours 50 of the drug from the blood gets excreted through urine remaining 25 will get excreted in fourth hour remaining 12 gets excreted in sixth hour it means if the solution reaches blood at am it gets completely excreted at am note the point that the external solution does not get absorbed through skin into blood thus need not to worry be careful with your vagina or oral because the vagina or oral is made by mucus membrane containing rich minute blood vessels vagina is different from skin in vaigna the absorption rate is higher and the diclofenac drug may reaches the blood better to avoid direct applying of diclofenac solution to vagina or nearby vagina or touching hands solution to vagina this carries some less risk to fetus if the solution is less no issues if the solution applied is more then little amount enters into your blood if more drug reaches fetus it inhibits prostaglandins in fetus heart which lead to unwanted problems in the heart you can involve in sexual activity then your husband can apply the drug or wash the hands with soap thoroughly before involving in sex I hope you could understand what I want to say,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

I was diagnosed with positive ana when tested for eczema could it be false positive,hello according to history it looks more like the skin is the only one troubling you I would like to ask you a few more queries did your rash resolve after the sun exposure was removed do you experience it on a daily basis when exposed to the sun or was it just due to prolonged exposure how about your other blood test like complete blood count ear erythrocyte sedimentation rate and liver function test yes it is true that ana antinuclear antibody can be a false positive in a lot of people but we need to be sure that it is not the start of a disease so only ana does not give us answers we need to see if it is causing inflammation in the blood which will be clear from other tests as per history it sounds more like a polymorphous light eruption which usually should improve itself but yes if your skin is sensitive you should avoid getting prolonged exposures like tat as they can be harmful to the skin,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

why bisexuality among men stigmatized in the past,hello bisexuality is common and a lot of men and women have bisexual orientation at some point in their lives this does not mean that a person will have homosexual relationship with same sex partner a person who is happily married might have liking for same sex too but this has been stigmatized in the past and because of cultural beliefs people never thought of accepting this in public since birth an individual is conditioned to behave in a particular manner like boys are supposed to be more active in competitive sports they are encouraged to be masculine while girls are supposed to be delicate sophisticated in most countries and most cultures if a boy behaves like girls he faces many issues like other peers make fun of him this conditioning is the basis of sexual orientation too boys are supposed to have girlfriends and girls have boyfriends homosexuality was considered as sin and even a lot of countries still consider homosexuality a crime and is stigmatized even these days media and the internet are working to reduce the stigma but in society people make fun of homosexuals especially of men this is the reason things are improving but still people do not look at bisexuality with good intentions,"Sorry, I didnt get you"
is it safe to wear contact lens while swimming,hello contact lenses should never be used while swimming contact lenses should never come in contact with water and patients are educated to never use water to clean or store lenses some people feel that wearing lenses underwater can help them see better this thought could perhaps have come in the mind of a professional swimmer or coach but unfortunately wearing contact lenses will not improve vision underwater the reason for this being that the eye is designed to work on the basis of a difference in the refractive index to put it in a simple way the difference in the refractive index between the eye and air is large hence vision is clear whereas the difference in refractive index is very small between our eye and water thus leading to blurred vision the only way to see clearly underwater is by using watertight swimming goggles which have a layer of air in front of the eye thus bringing back the difference in the refractive index swimmers with the refractive error may use contact lenses with their swimming goggles coming to the harmful effects of contact lens usage in water the most important being bacterial infections of the cornea called keratitis the commonest organism being pseudomonas is a very prolific bacteria this organism is the bane of every ophthalmologist thanks to a special trait it exhibits of boring through an intact and healthy cornea setting up deep seated hard to cure diseases the most characteristic organism seen would be acanthamoeba this organism is ubiquitous and infects untreated swimming pools and many natural water sources like rivers tanks lakes etc in which people swim in during hiking and outdoor activities all causes of such a corneal ulcer will need emergency hospital admission and treatment with intensive monitoring for signs of recovery if at all you are interested in wearing lenses while swimming the best option would be to use daily disposable lenses which can be disposed after swimming rigid lenses mostly will slip off the eye while swimming soft lenses usually are retained in the eye but will absorb most of the bacteria chemicals like chlorine etc used for treating the water this can set up a lot of inflammation and cause redness irritation and blurred vision to conclude I would say that wearing lenses underwater will not help you see well this blurring underwater can be overcome by wearing swimming goggles but not by contact lenses contact lens use while swimming will only cause serious eye problems and is to be best avoided,"Sorry, I didnt get you"
by what means mineral sunscreen is better than chemical one,hello sunscreen are agents that give protection to the skin against harmful ultraviolet radiation of the sun especially uv ultraviolet radiation that is more harmful sunscreen are of two types physical sunscreen and chemical sunscreen or sunblocks mineral sunscreen is another name for physical sunscreen physical sunscreen physically blocks sun ultraviolet radiations and chemical sunscreen absorbs uv radiations and chemically disperse them physical sunscreen are zinc oxide titanium oxide and iron oxide they are cosmetically unfavorable because they have to be applied thickly and evenly so they are visible on the applied skin whereas chemical sunscreen like octocrylene etc are not visible mineral sunscreen gives better protection than chemical ones they reflect the uv light whereas chemical sunscreen absorbs light and has more chance of photoallergy and contact dermatitis mineral sunscreen are better in this regard various cosmetics are using these mineral sunblock ingredients,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

will there be variation in spherical powers in a kid even while wearing glasses,hello I have gone through your attached photo there are both spherical and cylindrical powers in both of his eyes this power is large for a year old boy and I understand your concern regarding the cause the given age I will say that this power probably has to do with the pattern of his eye growth it is a bit longer than normal usually the most intelligent people who are bit more mature than the rest have to develop such a thing another important cause is seeing things by holding them very close for example phone books etc near work increases myopia but nobody can exactly predict what the cause could be regarding progression even if he wears the glasses regularly there could be variations in his power as I said this power is due to the lengthening of the eyeball and the eyeballs keep growing as he grows this is the reason why your doctor would have called you back for a follow up every six months or every year wearing glasses constantly helps in preventing complications like cross eyes squint and amblyopia lazy eye amblyopia is a condition where due to weakness of the visual nerve and brain vision centers the patient can no longer see the smallest letters even with the maximum power this can hamper his chances of getting into a few jobs like armed forces etc so the best course of action would be stop seeing things from close by avoid mobile phones computers and read books from as far away as possible do not rub the eyes this can increase the cylinder power wear glasses constantly to prevent complications like squint and amblyopia do not miss follow ups and consult your ophthalmologist in case of a sudden dip in vision I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"
will if help in avoiding chromosomal abnormality in future pregnancy,hello welcome to icliniq com as far as the subserous nature of the fibroid is concerned which is around 7cm am it per se is not going to have an effect or cause hindrance in conception but it is likely that it can cause problems during the pregnancy and in the late third trimester due to abdominal pain so it is advisable that it should be removed anyways as the size is a concern here and can cause incoordinate uterine contractions during labor later and also chances are that it would further grow under estrogen effect hence better get it removed as the fetus showed triploidy banded metaphase which as per the mother report she has high chances of replication of similar results in future pregnancies as well which may not be compatible with life and likely missed abortions may occur in future hence it is suggested that both of you should try for an if in vitro fertilization with ovum and sperm harvesting and in vitro fertilization of the egg by your sperm and subjecting the embryos to preimplantation genetic screening with fish fluorescence in situ hybridization technique or per polymerase chain reaction or comparative genomic hybridization cgh before selecting the embryo for transplanting into the uterus though the frequency of banded metaphase telomeric association is high for 3 16 and chromosome the chances of the fetus getting triploidy are very high another best option for you as a couple would be to opt for a donor egg from another woman which can be fertilized in vitro by your sperm and then the embryo after pre implantation genetic screening can be implanted in your wife womb to improve the chances of having a healthy conception I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"

is there any possibility for long sight along with myopic astigmatism,hello welcome to icliniq com in the prescription you have mentioned there are two components the spherical 75 and the cylindrical 5 at axes 70 10 respectively the important thing to note here is that reading glasses per se are given to people above 40 years of age in your case I feel that this power is probably your distance correction the doctor might have felt that they may be a bit cumbersome to wear all the time and would have given a small magnitude of power and probably have told you only to put them on during intense visual activities like watching computers reading books etc an accurate way to say whether these were meant for distance or for reading is to recall how you were tested at the doctor office in the first place suppose they made you sit at a distance and asked you to read out the letters on a screen then these are distance vision glasses if they had tested the power by giving you a book in your hand and asked you to read it then these would be reading glasses so coming back to your question firstly reading glasses are meant only for distances around am from you for the books and around 100 am for the computers and you would not be able to see beyond this second the far sighted power of 75 is determined by the length of your eyeball in case of far sightedness the eyeballs are shorter compared to normal and in near sightedness they are longer the astigmatic power is determined by the curvature of your cornea in your case myopic astigmatism the corneas are steeper at axes of 70 and 10 degrees respectively compared to the rest of the cornea in hypermetropic astigmatism they are flatter in that particular meridian compared to the rest of the cornea I hope this helps,"Sorry, I didnt get you"
